WebGLHello
==========

This is a simple WebGL hello world project set up to help get people a little up to speed on WebGL before trying to work with the wzrdschool game. It uses grunt and typescript the same way and just demonstrates a little bit about those technologies and the WebGL API

## To Get Started

1. make sure node is installed
2. clone this repository
3. cd into the repo
4. run `npm install`
5. run `grunt`
6. run `grunt watch`
7. in another terminal, run `grunt devserver`
8. open up the browser (tested in chrome) to localhost:8888
9. open up the `src/main.ts` to change the examples. If you change code, typescript will recompile automatically and you can refresh the browser to see the changes.
